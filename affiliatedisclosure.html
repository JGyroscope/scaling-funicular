            <h3>FTC Disclosure Compliance Rules</h3>
            <p>In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission released its new rules for Disclosure Compliance.</p>
            <p>These rules are set in place to ensure that readers or viewers of web media are aware if the blogger or publisher is sponsored, endorsed, or partnered with a different company. The readers need to know if the content publisher is making money by sharing a link or product.</p>
            <p>In compliance with the FTC guidelines, please assume the following about links and posts on this site:</p>
            <p>Any/all of the links on salehaleesa.com are affiliate links for which We receive a small compensation from sales of certain items.</p>
            <h3>What Are Affiliate Links?</h3>
            <p>Purchases are made on external affiliate company websites: when a reader clicks on an affiliate link located on salehaleesa.com to purchase an item, the reader buys the item from the seller directly (not from salehaleesa).</p>
            <p>Amazon and/or other companies pay salehaleesa a small commission or other compensation for helping to bring customers to their website.</p>
            <p>Prices are exactly the same for readers whether they purchase is through an affiliate link or a non-affiliate link. Clicking an affiliate link and clicking a non-affiliate link does not change the price or anything else for the visitor.</p>
            <p>salehaleesa uses two main types of affiliate programs:</p>
            <h3>1. Amazon affiliate links.</h3>
            <p>salehaleesa.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for website owners to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites, as well as to other websites that may be affiliated with Amazon Service LLC Associates Program.</p>
            <h3>2. Product affiliate links.</h3>
            <p>If you click a product affiliate link and buy the product, then We may get a percentage of the sale or some other type of compensation.</p>
