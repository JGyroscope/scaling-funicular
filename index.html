            hey man or woman who lives outside of the united states or inside it and has a little bit of money meaning a little bit over one thousand dollars to spend for this project and who has time and who has a computer and who actually wants to get their first sale in business and specifically through the use of the drop-shipping fulfillment model which means that you create a store online in the form of a website and list a couple of items that you want to sell and these items can be found on the website aliexpress which is a website that allows chinese businesses to sell to customers their products and so you can find unbranded products there because many chinese products are unbranded and they want to sell them to the world and the reason that they are unbranded is because there are many factories in china that produce products and they do that because they want to make money and so they produce unbranded products and sell them and maybe if one of them pops off and takes off the factory will brand the product and make it exclusive but many of the products they produce do not take off because the chinese factory may not be so good at marketing and selling the product but instead they just produce the product for other people to sell it and so there is an opportunity for you sell these products which are unbranded because the chinese factory wants to sell as many products as it can regardless if the product is branded or unbranded and so aliexpress has provided this opportunity for you and the chinese factories to connect and for you to buy these products so what you do next is when you find a product that you want to sell on aliexpress you copy this items details from aliexpress such as the product title and description and images and prices and paste them into your shopify store and then what you do is market this product however you can you can literally tell people to go buy it and maybe they will and maybe then you will get your first sale or maybe you can advertise for this product on social media or buses or highway billboards and then also maybe some people will buy it and in order to give you more value I will tell you that you will need to create a united states limited liability company which means a company that has its liability limited which means that you can only lose as much as you put into this company which means that if you put two thousand dollars into this business no one you do business with can take more than these two thousand dollars and dip their hands into your personal savings for example because a limited liability company protects you in a legal manner from this type of action and so you are a little bit safer than other types of business like a sole proprietorship which means that if you put an order in for two thousand products on a credit basis which means you pay for them later with the assumption that people will buy these products and then you cannot manage to sell them then with this business model your creditors who are the people who gave you credit which means the people who are loaning you the money will come after everything you have got until they get their money back so they will even take your house because you did not pay for their products and so after you create a united states limited liability company which you do if you are outside of the united states by using a company called doola or a company called stripe atlas which I have not used so I will talk about doola you give them a bunch of money and tell them to start you a business and they will do exactly that and so you now have a legal business in the united states which means that you can use stripe payments which is the same company that opens your business under the service name of stripe atlas but actually their main operation is being a payment processor and a payment processor is basically a company that you need in order to sell online because if you do not have a payment processor you cannot accept payments because someone has to write the code you need in order accept payments so someone has to actually write the code for the payment button which says pay which the customer clicks and more than these buttons and information fields so someone has to write the code for your website to accept emails for example for communication of payments and receipts other than that someone has to write the code for actually sending the virtual number your customer is willing to pay to you and because this virtual number is so important not many companies have the license to do that and because this virtual number is so regulated in the world because our world literally runs on it for trading stuff online only certain companies can do that so my point is that in order to get this virtual number which is literally just a number just like 7 or 8 and upload it to the server that everybody trusts like chase the company that uploads that number to the server has to be trustworthy so that is why you need stripe for payments and so after you use doola to create an official united states limited liability company and get your employer identification number which doola will do for you and get it from the united states internal revenue service they united states internal revenue service will email doola with a document or fax it to them and doola will upload this document to their website on your account dashboard you will then use this number you just copy and paste it into the required field when creating your stripe payments account and this way after you have entered your legal name uploaded your passport to stripe gave them your company name and gave them your employer identification number they will successfully give you an account to use on stripe and because stripe is integrated with shopify then when you are creating your store on shopify you can select stripe payments from shopifys list of accepted payments and now anyone who enters your website which you created from shopifys website and clicks on a product listing you have created and published and decides to buy that product and selects buy now he will now be able to successfully do that and enter his credit card information and the amount he paid the virtual number will be uploaded to your stripe account which you can connect to a bank account of yours and then stripe will upload this virtual number into your bank account and you will now see an updated number on your banking app or atm screen when you go there next time so the fundamentals are to create a united states business through doola and then open a stripe account and then create your shopify store and depending on how smart you are you will get some people into your website and buying your items which you will then literally just enter the customers details like address on aliexpress for the product you chose to list on your website and order from there on aliexpress but like instead of entering your own address you would enter your customers and then they would get the product
