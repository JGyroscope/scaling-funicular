<h1>my new blog</h1>
<main>
<p>This is my first new post. I am learning how to code. I am coding my own blog.</p>
<p>I believe that learning how to code while applying the concepts is a superior pedagogical technique than just following verbatim the instructions of the code website. In other words.. finding personal context and meaning in the things I am learning is surely a better way to incorporate them into my life!</p>
