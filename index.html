hey man or woman who lives outside of the united states or inside it and has a little bit of money meaning a little bit over one thousand dollars to spend for this project and who has time and who has a computer and who actually wants to get their first sale in business and specifically through the use of the drop-shipping fulfillment model which means that you create a store online in the form of a website and list a couple of items that you want to sell and these items can be found on the website aliexpress which is a website that allows chinese businesses to sell to customers their products and so you can find unbranded products there because many chinese products are unbranded and they want to sell them to the world and the reason that they are unbranded is because there are many factories in china that produce products and they do that because they want to make money and so they produce unbranded products and sell them and maybe if one of them pops off and takes off the factory will brand the product and make it exclusive but many of the products they produce do not take off because the chinese factory may not be so good at marketing and selling the product but instead they just produce the product for other people to sell it and so there is an opportunity for you sell these products which are unbranded because the chinese factory wants to sell as many products as it can regardless if the product is branded or unbranded and so aliexpress has provided this opportunity for you and the chinese factories to connect and for you to buy these products so what you do next is when you find a product that you want to sell on aliexpress you copy this items details from aliexpress such as the product title and description and images and prices and paste them into your shopify store and then what you do is market this product however you can you can literally tell people to go buy it and maybe they will and maybe then you will get your first sale or maybe you can advertise for this product on social media or buses or highway billboards and then also maybe some people will buy it
