         <h1 class="center">A reply to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/bigmoneymethod/status/1595481412026744840?s=46&t=WRKwxmEDf6bnkLsb4rIPVA">BigMoneyMethod</a></h1>
    <p class="center">Are you saying that twenty percent of consumers hold power over the rest of the eighty percent of people, then I agree. But show me how, make me understand. In fact, how does this relate to the fact that the business world is zero sum. Are you saying that because I am saying that everyone’s dollar is equal that I am a liar? Then I agree with you. Obviously the billionaire’s dollar holds more weight.. but that is only because of his other dollars. You see, the dollars are magical beings that actually transform right before your hands, and they hold exponential power. So that a dollar with more children is stronger than a single dollar, but not fundamentally. A dollar, in theory, is a dollar.</P>
    <p class="center">Yet you specifically addressed that and talked about reality, and there again I must agree. Reality is that in one sense, there is a gain from winning competition, and that is why people ultimately strive to get stronger. The other sense, the monastic, ascetic, weak, meditative, loser life is one who does not care about this obvious and lustful reality and prefers philosophy and thinking. Who prefers that happiness is equal in poor people and rich people. Is there a conclusion? I think people lose and win at the same time, and it is fucked up, end of story. It is about time we got over this. Convince me otherwise asshole.</p> 

    
    
    <h1 class="center">Express Yourself</h1>
    <p class="center">I must write sometimes. That is a sign that sometimes emerges when I am stuck on a particular point and unable to move forward. One of the signs of a great conversation – one must be sure not to hyperfocus on the individual signs lest he runs the risk of placing them God – is the flow and smooth quality of the conversation. In fact, this goes for everything in life, not just a conversation. I do not inform a man who lacks the ability to converse to “Ask question in the conversation,” but tell him that questions will inevitably come up.</p>
    
        
        <p>Hey guys, this is my new blog.</p>
        <section>
            <ol>
                <li>Link to a non-existent <a href="nonexistentpage.html">page..</a> should give a 404 status error..
                    the page is not found!</li>
                <li><button>This is a button.</button></li>
                <li><a href="Existent-page.html">This is a link to an existent page</a></li>
                <li>I can also control the width of some things around here. For example, look at this button:<button
                        style="width:100%">button</button></li>
                <li>Obviously, I can control the height as well.<button style="height:10px">button</button><button
                        style="height:20px">button</button><button style="height:40px">button</button></li>
