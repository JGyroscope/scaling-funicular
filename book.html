                <p>Book 1</p>
                <p>Note: keep things flowing and don't stop at long things. keep them bite-sized.</p>
                <p>flow the psychology of optimal experience</p>
                <p>One of the things this book taught me is that to be happy one must be in a state of flow, and how do you achieve that state of flow? By going in a life or death situation such as rock climbing with no fastened seat belts. If you fall, you will die, but you will also be happy. The point of this is that you are so focused on the current moment and situation that you no longer have time to think about anything else, for example: your past.</p>

                <p>Book 2</p>
                <p>Spark the revolutionary new science of exercise and the brain</p>
             
                <p>Listen, do you want to work out, and make money? Then read this book. For example: did you know that students who work out aerobically before their first class in school are better wired to learn? Those students that did cardiovascular exercise before first class improved their reading and comprehension skills by 17% compared with the regular students who just woke up and went to school without ever doing exercise. The latter students only improved by 10.7%. Which one do you want to be? Do you want to be a superior reader with excellent conversion skills or a mediocre one</p>

                <p>Book 3</p>
                <p>Free Will by Sam Harris</p>
                <p>This book is truly amazing because it confirms all my prejudices and opinions. To agree with such a smart man makes me feel grandiose and important. This book is lucid and makes sense if you have an open mind. Most people are compatibilists and they are losers. One must channel his energy.

                <p>Book 4</p>
                <p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</p>
                <p>To understand world leaders one must come as close to them as possible. What is more precious than the words of Hitler or Franklin in between our midst. To get a leadership mindset, one must be in proximity to the shining examples that human history has to offer.</p>

                <p>Book 5</p>
                <p>Next up we have Fooled By Randomness</p>
                <p>This book is written by an independent genius that gives you a fresh and new perspective somewhat outside of the mainstream media. This book is about philosophy, history and mythology, and of course.. Finance. Long story short: You are not a genius and you basically do not know anything. Stop acting like you do because you look like a fool asshole.</p>
