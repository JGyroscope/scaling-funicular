                <p>I have decided to only publish the original year of publication as opposed to including month and date. This is for big-picture of human history. The dates provided may not correspond directly to mainstream thought. In the philosophy behind this, I explain that I ultimately want to organize by the first reasonable date of the germination of the idea by my estimation.</p>

                <!-- <p>Note: keep things flowing and don't stop at long things. keep them bite-sized.</p> -->
                <p>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (Originally published: 1990)</p>
                <p>One of the things this book taught me is that to be happy one must be in a state of flow, and how do you achieve that state of flow? By going in a life or death situation such as rock climbing with no fastened seat belts. If you fall, you will die, but you will also be happy. The point of this is that you are so focused on the current moment and situation that you no longer have time to think about anything else, for example: your past.</p>

                <p>Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain by John Ratey (Originally published: 2008)</p>
             
                <p>Listen, do you want to work out? Then read this book. For example: did you know that students who work out aerobically before their first class in school are better wired to learn? Those students that did cardiovascular exercise before first class improved their reading and comprehension skills by 17% compared with the regular students who just woke up and went to school without ever doing exercise. The latter students only improved by 10.7%. Which one do you want to be? Do you want to be a superior reader with excellent comprehension skills or a mediocre one?</p>

                <p>Free Will by Sam Harris (Originally published: 2012)</p>
                <p>This book is truly amazing because it confirms all my prejudices and opinions. To agree with such a smart man makes me feel grandiose and important. This book is lucid and makes sense if you have an open mind. Most people are compatibilists and they are losers. One must channel his energy.

                <p>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (Originally published: 1791)</p>
                <p>To understand world leaders one must come as close to them as possible. What is more precious than the words of Hitler or Franklin in between our midst. To get a leadership mindset, one must be in proximity to the shining examples that human history has to offer.</p>

                <p>Fooled By Randomness by Nassim Taleb (Originally published: 2001)</p>
                <p>This book is written by an independent genius that gives you a fresh and new perspective somewhat outside of the mainstream media. This book is about philosophy, history and mythology, and of course.. Finance. Long story short: You are not a genius and you basically do not know anything. Stop acting like you do because you look like a fool asshole. I am sorry, but did you know that on average no money managers beat the S&P 500? Literally almost no mutual fund managers manage to beat the mother fucking market. Those who do? Definitely a statistical anomaly and likely to stop doing so soon.</p>

                <p>Beyond Good & Evil by Friedrich Nietzsche (Originally published: 1886)</p>
                <p>This is a bible. To begin with: why do we fight for truth, and who said Truth needed a savior, lmao. Second: If evolution programmed us for self-preservation first and foremost, then why do people skydive. This is a red pill, this whole book is a red pill that might shake you out of your moral naivety and put into the class with men and ambitious beings.</p>

                <p>Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl (Originally published: 1945)</p>
                <p>One of the things I remember about this book is that Holocaust prisoners would walk on German snow barefooted in the Winter. They would stand in lines when they came from the trains to the camp and this line would be for death and the other for labourers. Piles of corpses. Infants. Cannibalism. Industrialized murder. Resilience.</p>

                <p>How To Get Rich by Felix Dennis (Originally published: 2006)</p>
                <p>This is one of the first books I have read. It shows you this journey of a centi-millionaire who dies with around four hundred million dollars or so, and he is the one who writes this book. He tells you exactly how he got his money (the principles) and you get to be his friend while you read this book.</p>

                <p>A Problem From Hell by Samantha Power (Originally published: 2002)</p>
                <p>Are you interested in reading about genocide? Do you want to know what Pol Pot did when he closed the curtains on Cambodia in the late 1970s? How about the fact that he played god, and invisibly, so that the people of Cambodia had no idea who they were dealing with, just like a anonymous hostage situation. Nobody knew him, nobody saw him, this man brings you a live real life horror experiment that you dare not delve into unless you have the fortitude of your beliefs and convictions in God.</p>
