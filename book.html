                <p>Note: keep things flowing and don't stop at long things. keep them bite-sized.</p>
                <p>flow the psychology of optimal experience</p>
                <p>One of the things this book taught me is that to be happy one must be in a state of flow, and how do you achieve that state of flow? By going in a life or death situation such as rock climbing with no fastened seat belts. If you fall, you will die, but you will also be happy. The point of this is that you are so focused on the current moment and situation that you no longer have time to think about anything else, for example: your past.</p>

                <p>Listen, do you want to work out, and make money? Then read this book. For example: did you know that students who work out aerobically before their first class in school are better wired to learn? Those students that did cardiovascular exercise before first class improved their reading and comprehension skills by 17% compared with the regular students who just woke up and went to school without ever doing exercise. The latter students only improved by 10.7%. Which one do you want to be? Do you want to be a superior reader with excellent conversion skills or a mediocre one</p>
